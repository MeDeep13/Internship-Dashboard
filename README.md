 # END-TO-END DATA-PIPELINE FOR INTERNSHIP INSIGHTS

### Overview 📌

This Project is an end-to-end data analytics solution built using Python, BeautifulSoup, and Power BI. It scrapes over 6,500+ live internship listings from over 140 pages and cleans and processes the data, automates daily refreshes, and visualizes internship trends across India's various locations using an interactive Power BI dashboard.

### Why did I build it? 🤔

* It is mainly build for students who are looking for internships by **role** and **location**, and **compare** the **Stipend** offered as per different roles and locations.
* It helps find an estimate of the average stipend offered and understand what a **Competitive Stipend** should look like.
* It can also help recruiters/companies to decide the stipend as per the market trends.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

* **Python** - Data scraping, preprocessing, and automation
* **BeautifulSoup** - Web scrapping internship listings
* **Pandas** - Data manipulation and cleaning
* **Power BI** - Interactive dashboard and analytics
* **Window Task Scheduler** - Automating data scraping and cleaning on log in once per day at a 15 minutes delay.
